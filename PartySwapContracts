PartySwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche Network; It works as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where users can do permissionless swaps between currencies adding the use of smart contracts to create markets for any given pair of tokens.

The PartySwap users can earn our reward token $PARTY by being Liquidity Providers on our platform; users can earn Yields on our farming pairs called "Pinatas" and our single-sided pools, better known as "Jacuzzis."

The Project focuses on giving the users a good experience while using Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Avalanche, adding additional features not found on other Avalanche DEXs having a unique and fun branding.

In the second phase of the platform, we will also increase the utility of the platform token $PARTY, adding a lottery and a wide range of games where the PartySwap users can earn $PARTY rewards by playing or betting against other users.

In the future, we plan to integrate a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and a Subnet in the Avalanche Network, mainly centered on bringing a more decentralized approach into the decision-making of our Project and increasing the development possibilities.
